Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?
Yep, out like a light!
This sure trumps
the "Has he pooped?" series.
Ross, we love him, okay?
But right now he's just
a little fat guy.
How excited can we get?
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!
The One Where Rachel Finds Out
Here's little Ben nodding off.
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
-Look, he's got Ross haircut.
-Let me see.
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just wanna kiss him all over.
That would be nice.
-Pardon?
-Nothing.
Just a little extra air in my mouth.
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.
Right. Including the waffles
last week, you now owe me...
... 1 7 jillion dollars.
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with research.
What kind of research?
Just, you know, science.
Science.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
It's a fertility study.
Joey, please tell me you're only
donating your time.
Actually, a little more than that.
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
I just go down there
every other day...
...and make my contribution
to the project.
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.
That's funny. Very funny.
This is great. I actually know
somebody who loves what they do.
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.
The ground-up flesh
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.
I just love barbecuing with you.
Men are here!
We make fire.
Cook meat.
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.
Cute.
-Melanie called. She'll be late.
-Okay.
How are things going? Is she
becoming your "special someone"?
I don't know. She's pretty great.
What does she think of
your little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
The tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex.
Crazy bitch.
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...
... I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.
They don't want us to have it.
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.
Could you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father."
"I am The Head!"
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.
I wanted to wish Rachel
a happy birthday before I left.
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.
-There's this guy she met at
-The coffeehouse? Right.
So you do know who he is.
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.
-I have to go to China.
-The country?
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.
Do you know who Carl is?
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?
-Forget about her.
-He's right.
Please move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.
Of course, there
they just call it "food."
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.
I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you.
I'm still on my first.
I just think you're nice.
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers."
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!
We're doing presents first.
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...
...complete the transaction,
if you know what And you do.
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?
What do you mean?
You know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
Think about it.
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.
Okay. It's light. It rattles.
It's...
...Travel Scrabble!
Thank you.
This one's from Joey.
It feels like a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!
It's Dr. Seuss!
That book got me through
some tough times.
There's a little child
inside this man.
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.
Oh, my God! He remembered!
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.
I told him it was like one
my grandma had when I was little.
I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe it.
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...
...and bought her that
expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Crystal duck.
No, no, no. The "love" part?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!
I know.
This is really, really huge.
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.
Is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...
... but nothing ever happened.
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?
Given that he's in love with you...
... he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.
Ross? All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!
-The country.
Is his flight gone?
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:
He's gone!
His flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.
What'll you say to him?
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good, tell him now.
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!
All right.
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?
I need to talk to my friend.
Sorry, you're not allowed here
without a pass.
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can l?
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?
-This is very important.
-All right. What's the message?
I don't know.
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.
What?
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.
You know what?
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.
How do you mean?
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"
But you, you're a giver.
You're the most generous man
I ever met.
I mean, you're practically a woman.
-You're just saying that.
-No.
A woman!
-So?
-I missed him.
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.
Yeah, right.
No, I feel bad for her. I do.
I can think of somebody
other than myself.
All right, I'm going to bed.
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.
Yes!
Pizza coupons.
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?
That'd be great.
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or should I throw it out?
I don't know. I don't know.
Thought about it
all the way there...
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!
You know what I mean? It's Ross.
-Sure!
-Sure.
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...
... but I'm thinking
it'd be really great.
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!
The best part is you already
know all about him.
You start on the 1 5th date.
But it would be like
starting on the 1 5th date.
Another good point.
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're already in a very...
... "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.
What happens if it doesn't work out?
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?
-No, I'm just
-Maybe there's someone else.
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.
Then why are you dumping my brother?
Hey, big Spender!
She's still asleep.
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.
Last night I couldn't do the thing
that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!
It was like a ticker-tape parade!
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...
... but all my other senses
are heightened.
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...
...on another level.
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did l!
Is something going on with O.J.?
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?
-From who?
-You.
I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought.
Doesn't Ross'flight get in
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.
Why?
I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure
No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...
... but I'll be good. I promise.
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks.
You know what?
I feel I learned something.
You'll stick with this
"all for her" thing?
What are you, crazy?
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...
...in that stupid electric car,
I'm gonna shoot myself!
I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...
...it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
I'm thinking about you. So what?
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?
Happens to be a very nice guy.
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you
What makes you think that?
Have you been involved
where you haven't broken up?
No.
But it only has to happen once.
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?
I don't know.
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.
Well, start looking.
-Wow.
-Exactly!
And I'm gonna be the guy...
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!
Right! You're right.
You know what?
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.
I am so sorry!
If you wanna finish your drinks,
please do.
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.
Hello!
-Where you going?
-Airport.
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.
I haven't watched Baywatch
with Yasmine Bleeth!
Chandler, relax. This is a good
going to the airport.
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!
Yes, another successful case
for the love doctor.
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?
There's no Rachel!
Hey! I got that.
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.
You don't think they'll judge me?
-No, they will. I just....
-Can't wait!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
-Tell him.
-Tell him.
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?
You won't look at him.
I could use another
reason why women won't look at me.
All right. All right.
Last night, I had a dream...
...that you and I were
Doing it on this table.
Excellent dream score.
Why would you dream that?
More importantly...
...was I any good?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.
I love it when we share.
You okay?
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream.
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.
The One With The lck Factor
Hello, Rachel.
Get off.
Ooh, give me. Can you see me
operating a drill press?
I don't know.
What are you wearing?
Why would you want to?
For short-term work. Till I get
back my massage clients.
Pirates again?
No. Nothing like that.
I'm just such a dummy.
I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home"
workshop. And they are.
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.
I could. I could do it. What is it?
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.
It's a whole big boob story.
-I could be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing...
... because it involves being
normal for a large portion of the day.
I could do that.
-What's that?
-My new beeper.
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
Help. They're still extinct.
It's for when Carol goes into labor.
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.
-See you later.
-Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan?
Young?
He's our age.
When we were....
-He's a senior in college.
-College?
Rob that cradle.
He's smart and mature and grown-up.
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue...
... because I said I was 22.
-You what?
-What?
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.
-I am 26.
-There you go.
Can you hear that?
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.
Mr. Bing's office.
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.
Will he know what
this is in reference to?
And he has your number?
I'll see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.
Ross says hi.
This is so fun.
What do we do now?
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.
"Most likely."
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
All right. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
-Yes?
-What you doing?
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since...
... his midterms.
Why, all of a sudden,
are you so...?
-What?
-Could tonight be the night?
I don't know. He's a great guy...
...and I love being with him.
But, you know...
...things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.
-So, did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.
Would you let it go?
It was just a dream.
It doesn't mean
This is it. It's baby time!
All right, relax. Just relax.
Be cool.
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.
Yes, I am sure.
I do not perform
those kind of services.
Services?
Oh, services.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.
That's right.
That's right.
JUMBO with a "U," sir.
You don't want me.
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.
Alrighty, bye-bye.
How was the first day?
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.
Me.
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why?
Well, because, you know.
They don't like you.
-What?
-I thought you knew.
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.
Except for....
No. Everyone.
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.
They used to like you a lot.
But you got promoted, and now you're
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah. They even do you.
They "do" me?
You know, like, okay:
"Could that report be any later?"
-I don't sound like that.
-Yeah, you do.
"The hills are alive
with the sound...
...of music."
"My scone. My scone."
I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.
That is so not
That is so not
That
Oh, shut up.
-Did not.
-Up until I was 9...
... I thought "gunpoint" was
a place where crimes happened.
-How's that possible?
-It's always on the news.
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."
"Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint."
And I kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"
I should go.
-Unless
-What?
Unless you wanna stay over.
I mean, I'm going to. So....
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff...
...there's something you should know.
Is this, like,
"I have an early class tomorrow"...
...or "I'm secretly married
to a goat"?
Well, it's somewhere in between.
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not....
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....
Ethan?
Are you a virgin?
If that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then...
...yes, I am.
I mean, you're just such a good kisser
I would never have known.
Well, I've excelled at every level
I've been to, I just....
I just haven't been to
that particular one yet.
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You do know I was talking
about you, right?
Wow.
You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...
...it is nothing like that.
Listen, listen.
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.
Don't tell me I did it wrong.
Nothing wrong about that.
Here goes.
I'm not 22.
I'm 25...
...and 1 3 months.
But I figure that shouldn't
change anything.
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.
I just thought
you were naturally minty.
Listen...
...as long as we're
telling stuff...
... I have another one for you.
I'm a little younger than I said.
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior...
...in high school.
What we did was wrong.
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?
-You never said your age.
-It's different.
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states.
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling
-Don't say it.
-ln love with you.
-Really?
-Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night.
Oh, God.
I'm like those women
that you see...
...with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.
Alrighty. Bye-bye.
It's just easier that way.
-You told me about the last dream.
-No. Forget it.
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?
All right. Fine.
You were not the only one there.
Joey was there too.
All right.
Was there...
...anybody else there?
You sure? Nobody...
... handing out mints or anything?
No, it was just the three of us.
So was it you and Chandler...
...then you and me,
or you, me and Chandler?
-You know what?
-What?
There were times...
...when it wasn't even me.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Mon, Ethan called again.
-What?
-Ethan called again.
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.
Sometimes, things don't work out.
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?
I did not say anything. I swear.
-He stopped by.
-Next time you talk to him...
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?
Sorry.
"It's morphin'time."
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.
I gotta go.
Head rush.
One more, and then I have to go.
Cool.
Where you going?
A birthday party
with some work people.
Work people? Nobody told me.
I know.
That's part of the whole...
...them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.
A month ago,
these people were my friends.
I'm in charge,
but I'm not a different person.
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.
-You think I should?
-I really do.
But could we not go together?
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.
This may take some time
for him to get over it...
... but, then at four,
Muppet Babies is on.
Go deep. Deep. Deep.
Sorry, Shelly.
See, with the fun?
Last night was great.
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory."
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy
Boss Man Bing.
Then I don't get it.
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.
You're the guy in the big office.
You're the one that hires
and fires them.
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?
But they're not
your friends anymore.
-I just want
-But you can't.
But I just want
Are you gonna?
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1...
...she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.
What about Andre?
He got a call
from our cousin, Nathan.
Frankly, it was a little more
than I needed to know.
That was gonna be my opener.
Have you guys seen those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was vulnerable.
I'm actually 30. I have a wife
and a job. I'm your congressman.
This is ridiculous.
We're great together.
We can talk, make each other
laugh, and the sex....
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.
-lt was.
-Then what's the problem?
Ethan, it's....
It's icky.
"lcky"?
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's "icky"?
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.
If you were older
or I was younger...
...or we lived in biblical times...
-... I could really
-No, don't say it.
Love you.
-Are your hands still wet?
-Moist.
Let's dry them again.
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"
Hey, Chandler.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.
-Sure.
-No problem.
You have to give them something.
That was Gerston, Santos, and
who's the other guy?
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.
Well, some people
are gonna be working...
...this weekend.
Oh, that's nice.
Ross.
I'm here.
You are?
We were just....
What?
-Great. Now I'm having a baby.
-What?
I'm having a baby. I'm having a
-The phone, the phone.
-I don't have the phone.
I'm hurt.
Let's go.
Come on, people. Woman in labor.
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.
We're going to a hospital.
I can't look nice?
There are doctors there.
-Joey, get out of the fridge.
-All right.
-What is that?
-For the ride.
-Like in a cab
-Save it.
-Hating this.
-Monica, come on. Let's go.
Baby coming.
I can't believe I'm gonna be
an aunt.
-I'll have a nephew.
-That's nice. Get out.
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.
Here we go. Come on.
I can't believe
you'd actually say that.
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.
No way.
Mr. Salty is a sailor.
He's gotta be
the toughest snack there is.
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with Cornnuts.
They're crazy.
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.
I can't believe it.
He's looking right at us.
Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated.
And not in a good way.
How can people do that?
You guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.
The One With the Evil Orthodontist
Years from now,
school children will study it...
...as one of the greatest
first dates ever.
-Yeah.
-I'll say, yeah.
It was unbelievable.
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.
-Have you called her?
-She'd know I like her. That's crazy.
Guys. It's gross.
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?
-I'm right. Right?
-Yeah, let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are
pushing me to find one of you people.
Come on. Just do it.
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.
So, why didn't you say anything?
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...
... I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look.
What's going on?
-They're just talking.
-Does he look upset?
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?
No. Actually, he's smiling.
Oh, my God. Don't do that.
What? What? What?
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.
See? Hey, Rach.
How'd it go?
You know, it was actually
really great.
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.
Not a good day for birds.
Then we went to Bendel's.
And I told him not to, but he got me
a bottle of Chanel.
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...
...to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?
Right. Well, we never actually
got to that.
It was just so nice to see him again.
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.
It was just nice.
That's nice twice.
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?
Where have you been?
It was different
with him today.
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?
-Why?
-I have my reasons.
He's engaged to another woman...
...who happens to be
your ex-best friend?
All right.
I know it's stupid.
I'll see him this afternoon
and put an end to it.
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.
No, it wasn't.
It was so nice
having this little sink here.
Then with authority, hang up.
Will you just leave her the message?
Okay. All right, fine.
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.
Give me a call
when you get a chance.
Bye-bye.
Oh, God.
That's what you've been working on
for two hours?
Hey, I've been honing.
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.
I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here...
... honing for the last two hours?
-The telescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.
Go away.
Stop looking in here.
Great.
Now he's waving back.
We gotta do something.
I caught him looking into our place.
I feel like I can't do stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...
...but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.
What's the matter?
I just
Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was.
It was very, very good.
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?
If you want, I'll
break it off with her.
No, don't do that.
Not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice.
Let's go away this weekend.
-This is all way too
-No, we can go to Aruba.
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...
...it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.
We're starting to see
some real progress.
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?
For future reference,
that thing in your hand...
...can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working.
-Why isn't she calling?
-Maybe she never got your message.
Call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...
...that means she didn't get
her messages yet.
-Doesn't that make me seem?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?
You obviously saw my personal ad.
How many beeps?
She answered.
This is where you'd use
that "hello" word.
I won't talk to her.
She got my message...
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.
God, I miss just being needy.
So how'd he take it?
Pretty well, actually.
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?
Oh, do l?
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't l?
You had what?
Sex in his chair.
What...? What were you thinking?
I don't know.
We still care about each other.
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.
It's nothing like me and Carol.
If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...
... right here, right now,"
what would you say?
If it helps, I could slide over.
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians
I gotta go.
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.
I have things to do with my life.
I have a jam-packed schedule.
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?
Mindy.
How are you?
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.
Really, oh, God
I'm working tomorrow, but if you
want, you can come by if you'd like.
Great.
Great.
So I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
So how's Mindy?
She wants to see me tomorrow. She
sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.
It's me. I just
Mindy.
Mindy. No, I figured
that's where you'd be.
Hell is filled
with people like you.
He's back.
The peeper's back.
-Get down.
-Get down?
And boogie.
I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
She may not even know.
I haven't heard from her in seven
months, what else is it about?
She was my best friend.
We went to camp together,
she taught me how to kiss....
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.
-I feel so
-Naughty.
-See you later.
-I'll walk with you.
When she taught you to kiss, were you
wearing any kind of little uniform?
That's fine, yeah.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date...
-...she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you call her?
I can't. I left a message.
I have some pride.
-Do you?
-No.
Danielle, hi.
It's Chandler.
I'm fine.
Listen....
I don't know if you tried
to call me because...
... I accidentally shut off my phone.
That's fine. That's great. Okay.
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back.
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.
Hey, you.
So what's up?
We should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should.
I'm gonna ask once,
and I want a straight answer.
Not like when I asked if those red
pants made my ass look big.
I know things have been weird...
...but you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie...
...who's bitter because
she lost weight...
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.
Will you be my maid of honor?
-Of course.
-That's so great.
It is. It is. It is.
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.
-What?
-That's not all.
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.
What would make you think that?
Since the engagement,
he's acted weird.
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.
Really?
If it'll make you feel any better...
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he was weird too.
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.
What's what you were afraid of?
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and l...
... kind of had
a little thing on the side.
-What?
-I know, I know.
When he proposed, people said, "He'll
do to you what he did to Rachel."
And now I feel so stupid.
You are so stupid.
We are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my.
Four letters, "circle or hoop."
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?
I called and there was no answer.
I turned it off.
Mother of God, I turned it off.
Just like you told her you did.
Just pointing out the irony.
I went across the street
to the doorman.
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?
Can I use your phone?
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device."
Radiator.
Five letters.
"Rdtor."
Yeah, is Sidney there?
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman, so what?
Yeah, so what?
I live across the street, and I know
about your telescope.
And I don't appreciate it.
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?
If I wanna walk around in my
underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
Thank you.
That's not really the point.
The point is, that
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.
The green dress? Really?
She said you looked like
lngrid Bergman.
Did she mention me?
She wants to know why you tie
the towel around your head.
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?
It's a leave-in conditioner.
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.
Come on...
-...in.
-Hello, sweetheart.
What you guys doing here?
We are here to break up with you.
Both of you?
We think you're a horrible person,
and bad things should happen to you.
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.
I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.
Which one of us
are you talking to there?
Mindy.
Of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.
When we were having sex
in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was thinking of you.
Please. That second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.
You did it twice?
The first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.
Honey, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.
We'll start over.
We'll go back to Aruba.
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deal with the airlines?
What do you say?
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.
Jason Castalano 's choking
on his retainer.
Oh, God.
I'll be right there, Bernice.
Look, please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you.
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...
...and take some punches.
This feels great.
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?
Mindy, the guy is the devil.
He is Satan in a smock.
I know he's not perfect.
But the truth is at the end of
the day, I still really wanna be...
... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...
... D. D.S.
Oh, God.
I hope you can find a way
to be happy for me.
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.
You okay?
Really?
Since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...
...I've wondered whether I made
the right choice.
And now I know.
I'm so glad.
Big day.
I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
He's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat....
Did you know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle, hi.
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.
Why are you here?
I've been calling,
but I had your number wrong.
When I got the right one,
there was no answer.
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.
I'm okay.
Maybe we could get together later?
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.
You got it.
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.
-There you go.
-Second date.
I don't know.
You don't know?
She seems nice, but her coming
all the way here...
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
Okay, I checked.
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
Cinnamon Stick...
...Chamomile, Mint Medley,
Blackberry and
Wait, there's one more.
Lemon Soother!
You're not the guy that asked
for tea, are you?
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.
Thank you.
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.
Oh, good. Because where else
would we get any?
Oh, right.
-Oh, great.
-What is it?
Country club newsletter.
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!
Barry, who you almost
And Mindy, your maid of
Let me see. That's Mindy?
She is pretty!
Lucky...
...to have had a friend like you.
Now it's quiet time.
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.
Good boy. Give me the rice.
Thank you. Good boy.
He's mastered the difference between
"bring me the" and "pee in the."
"Bring me the" and
Rach?
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is so stupid!
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
I should be happy for them.
I am. I'm happy for them.
-Really?
-No.
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.
Whoa, what....
What happened to "Forget
relationships! I'm done with men!"
The whole penis embargo?
I don't know.
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.
With Barry it was safe and easy,
but there was no heat.
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual
-Right. I got it.
I was there.
Do you think you can have both?
Someone who's your best friend
but also can make your toes curl.
Yes.
Yes, I do. I really do.
In fact, it's funny.
Often, someone
you wouldn't think could...
...curl your toes...
... might just be the one who...
...gets interrupted.
How was the movie?
-Wonderful!
-So good!
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with guns and bombs...
...and buses going really fast!
I don't need violence
in a movie...
...as long as
there's a little nudity.
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
All right, I've got to go.
Come on, Marcel.
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?
They're still just friends, right?
And I will see you tomorrow.
You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Please, Aunt Monica, please?
Unclench. You're not even
gonna be here.
-I can't believe we're discussing this.
-I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
If it was gonna happen,
wouldn't it have happened already?
She said she wants a relationship
with someone exactly like me.
She said that?
I added the exactly like me" part.
But she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.
"Tonight" tonight?
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd pick up some wine...
...go over there and try to woo her.
Know what you should do?
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.
If you keep this up, you'll be
finished by the weekend.
The one in the feathered boa
is Dr. Francis.
Now, she used to be a man.
Look, there's Raven.
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
And then
What? Marcel!
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!
Oh, God!
Sorry, Barry.
A little engagement gift.
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.
Who died? Who died?
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because
Marcel?
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!
We were watching TV,
he pooped in Monica's shoe....
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?
I don't know. The left one!
Which ones?
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.
Why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh, no! How?
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?
The cute black ones I always wear.
No, which one?
The right or left?
Because the left one is lucky.
Come on!
What am I gonna do?
All right. You're a monkey.
You're loose in the city.
Where do you go?
It's his first time out,
so he'll do touristy things.
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!
He'll be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me!
Search the building. Take the first
floor. We'll take the rest.
What am I gonna do?
You stay here
and wait by the phone.
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.
Does anybody want to trade?
What do you want?
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?
-Why'd you leave it in the hall?
-I wasn't ready for it.
Have you seen a monkey?
I saw Regis Philbin once.
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.
Thanks.
How did it go today?
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.
Is that wine?
You want some?
Oh, I would love some.
But let's not drink it here.
I'm feeling crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?
Okay, but before we head off to
the murder capital of the Northeast...
... I kind of wanted
to run something by you.
You know how we
were talking before...
...about relationships, and stuff.
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.
Oh, God!
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.
Please don't hate me.
What?
You know Marcel?
I kind of lost him.
I can't believe this.
All I asked you to do was
keep him in here!
I know. I'm sorry.
It's partially my fault.
I shouldn't have had you
start with a monkey.
You should have started
with a pencil.
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's looking for him and I got
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?
Why? Do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
I'm not allowed to have him. If they
find him, they'll take him away.
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!
Thanks for coming.
Somebody called about a monkey?
You know, that was
a complete misunderstanding.
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.
-My uncle Marcel.
-ls that who the monkey's named after?
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable...
... by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.
Oh, my God!
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time.
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.
Oh, my God, you are!
And you're Rachel Greene!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
Luisa! Oh, my God!
Monica! It's Luisa!
I went there too!
Luisa! From homeroom!
You have no idea who I am, do you?
-No.
-Not at all.
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.
Would it have been hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...
...or "Nice overalls"?
Oh, I'm so sorry!
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.
But you. What a bitch!
What?
You know what? Be that as it may...
...could you help us with the
monkey thing, for old times'sake?
Go, Bobcats!
I could. But I won't.
If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Sorry.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
We're having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?
No, I haven't seen a monkey.
Can you fix radiators?
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?
-Of course!
-Oh. Then, no.
-Taste this. Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!
We may not know about radiators...
... but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.
Aren't we in the middle of something?
But these women are very hot,
and they need our help.
And they're very hot!
We can't, all right?
We're sorry.
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.
He's this high
and answers to the name Marcel.
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Something brushed up
against my right leg.
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.
Look, Phoebe!
Oh, Marcel! Come here!
Step aside, ladies.
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquilizer.
Run, Marcel, run!
Damn!
-Are you okay?
-I think so.
Oh, gosh!
We've been all over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!
-You don't know that.
-It's cold, it's dark.
He doesn't know the Village!
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!
Thank you very much!
I've said I'm sorry a million times.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...
... I don't miss Marcel anymore!
It's not like
I did this on purpose.
No, this is just vintage Rachel.
Things just sort of happen around you!
You're off in "Rachel Land,"
doing your "Rachel Thing"...
...oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and
I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?
What?
Hey, banana man!
This is so intense!
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.
-What's with Phoebe?
-Tranquilizer dart.
Hi! Did you order some bananas?
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?
Potassium.
Okay, where is he?
You're wasting your time.
What?
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey. That's Patty.
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey!
Gotcha!
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.
Take this up with the judge.
That's not my monkey. The dress
is mine. Send it back whenever.
All right, I want my monkey!
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in school,
instead of fat.
In high school, I was prom queen...
...and the homecoming queen and you...
...were also there.
But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!
Heckles! Can I have this?
For the most part.
If you take this monkey, I'll lose
an important person in my life.
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.
You have a chance
to be the bigger person here.
Take it!
No.
All right. Then I'll call
your supervisor and tell her...
...you shot my friend with a dart!
It'll be nice to get this off,
won't it?
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.
With the right pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before
No, it was my fault.
I almost lost your
Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.
We still have that bottle of wine.
Are you in the mood
for something grape?
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.
The neighbors must be vacuuming.
Well, as long as we're here...
...and not on the subject....
I was thinking about...
... how mad we got
at each other before.
And maybe it was partially
because of how we
-Rachel?
-Barry?
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.
I think I'm still in love with you.
We have got to start
locking that door!
Show us! Come on!
-lt was such a long time ago.
-Okay, fine. All right.
This is me in The Sound of Music.
See the von Trapp kids?
That's because I'm in front of them.
Big nun!
I thought that was an alp.
High school wasn't
my favorite time.
I loved high school.
It was four years of parties,
dating and sex and
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?
My butt cheek is waking up!
We're running low on resumes.
You want a job
with Popular Mechanics?
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."
-Paper cut! Paper cut!
-Here.
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!
Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your "compuper" skills.
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.
The One With the Poker
They call this a love seat but I'm not
feeling anything special towards you.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.
Hi, ladies.
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.
-Really? Sure, we have scones left!
Read them.
"Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However"
-We have apple cinnamon
-"Dear Ms. Greene...." Yeah, yeah! No.
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!
Give me that.
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?
-I don't know.
-ls this about her...
... "The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...
...who gets my heart pounding.
Who makes me....
Little playthings with yarn?
What?
Could you want her more?
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!.
Look, I'm totally over her.
-Hi!
-Coffee?
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.
-What?
-Joey cried last night.
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep!"
And then he did.
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No. Women can play.
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know
All right, what is it?
There are just no women
in our game.
We just don't know any
women who know how to play poker.
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.
Do you know how to play?
No.
-But you could teach us.
-No.
Okay, so now we draw cards.
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.
-No, you can't
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.
Thanks!
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Oh, you're
You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you? Thanks, man.
Here we go.
We've got salmon roulettes
and crudites.
What are you doing?
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syllable.
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz
I hope you'll let it slide just
this once. I was all out of "pretz."
Now the dealer
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks!
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't look happy.
But I'm ready. So just deal.
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey....
Three.
Eight.
Eight. Three.
All right, very good.
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was
Yes?
Downright gutsy.
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.
And what is bluffing?
Is it not another word for lying?
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.
See, King George is giving us
the land....
-The game, Rachel. You owe us money.
-Right.
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.
Hell, no. We'll pay!
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.
And you know what?
We want a rematch.
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.
For me to win,
others have to lose.
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.
Because once those cards are dealt....
Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
All right, let's eat.
Did you get that
from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."
You're way off.
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!
No. I might have had feelings
for her at one time. Not anymore.
I just
Marcel! Where are you going
with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.
What?
"Hello, kettle? This is Monica.
You're black!"
Please!
I'm not as bad as Ross.
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?
That wasn't an incident.
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?
Saks Fifth Avenue.
Oh, Rachel!
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.
I would be shopping!
For a living!
That's Aunt lris. She's been
playing poker since she was 5.
You've got to listen
to every word she says.
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.
Let me tell you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?
We'll start with five-card draw.
Then we'll go into the studs and the
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is dealing.
How is Nathan?
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?
It should be so simple.
Ross, could we please listen
to anything else?
All right.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Hi. Guys, guess what?
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're all recommending Trident?
No, the interview!
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.
And I went to camp with her cousin.
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.
Let's play poker!
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?
Very funny.
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.
So Pheebs owes $7. 50.
Monica owes $10.00.
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta play that other way.
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.
-What?
-I cursed it!
Now bad things will happen
to the spender.
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
This way, I can split them up
with a movie.
So that just leaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.
Could you be any smugger?
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gallery...
...and I could sure use the portraits
of Lincoln and Hamilton.
It's so typical.
"I'm a man! I have a penis!
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!"
This isn't over.
We'll play you again.
We'll win. You'll lose.
You'll beg. We'll laugh.
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?
Like 30 bucks.
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?
Yes!
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formality of really playing.
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.
Right. Serious poker.
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.
Want to go to the bathroom
or play poker?
Go to the bathroom.
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody, ante.
Yes!
Or no.
-All right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!
Coincidence?
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.
-I'm in.
-Me too.
Me too.
What do you got?
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.
Well, well, well!
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!
I got four sixes! I won!
I actually won! Oh, my God!
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.
Look!
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it
And your fly's still open
I made you look
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.
Monica, in or out?
I hate this game!
Joey, your bet.
I fold like a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...
... by a fat guy
with sores on his face.
I'm out.
-Ross?
-I'm very in.
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.
Me too. Rachel?
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?
No, not this time.
What did you have?
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.
-No.
-Show them!
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!
Plus, that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.
Hello. Rachel Greene.
Excuse me. It's about the job!
Barbara, hi! How are you?
No, I understand.
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly. Yeah.
But if anything else
opens up, please
Hello?
Sorry, Rach.
There's gonna be lots
of other stuff.
Okay.
Where were we?
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.
-All right. Check.
-Check.
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.
I'm in.
I see your 50 cents...
...and I raise you $5.
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.
I just lost a job,
I'd like to raise it $5.
Does anyone have
a problem with that?
-Not at all.
-No.
Loser?
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."
Were you just full of it?
I'm in.
-How many do you want?
-One.
Dealer takes two.
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.
Okay. I see your $2...
...and I raise you...
I see your $20...
... raise you $25.
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Okay, then get me your purse.
-Here you go. Good luck!
-Thank you.
I saw your $25 and I raise you...
...seven.
teen!
Joey, I'm a little shy.
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.
-What do you need?
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
I am calling your 1 7.
What do you got?
Full house.
You got me.
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.
But look how happy she is.
-Airmail.
-Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!
Airport '77! Airport '79!
Time's up!
Bye Bye Birdie!
That's a bird?
That's a bird!
Okay, it's my turn.
Go!
Bean! Bean!
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!
That you get?
That you get?!
Coffee.
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.
Thank you.
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?
That's why.
Sorry.
The One With The Stoned Guy
Chandler?
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.
That is a very flattering
sleeve length on you.
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office today.
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't involved.
Nothing at all. Really.
And frankly, those shenanigans have
no place in an office environment.
Hey, you guys!
Chandler's coming and
he has incredible news.
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.
What's going on?
So it's a typical day at work...
...and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.
-That is great!
-Congratulations!
So I quit.
Why?
Why? This was a temp job.
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toilet paper?
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?
Was it more money?
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...
...worrying about the WENUS.
The "WENUS"?
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.
Oh, that WENUS.
What will you do?
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.
I have something you can do!
I have this new massage client, Steve.
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...
...and he's looking for a head chef.
-Hi, there.
-Hi.
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so....
I just don't have a lot
of chef-ing experience.
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
What is he looking for?
He wants to do something eclectic.
He's looking for someone
who can create the entire menu.
So, what do you think?
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big, white hat.
Oh, Monica! Guess what?
a perfect run-up
and there he goes, a perfect....
Watch stuff like this...
...and you realize
why evolution is just a theory.
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going?
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!
-I added the "a-go-go."
-Career counselor?
You guys all know
what you want to do.
I don't.
You guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.
You have goals. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!
The lesser-known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.
I love my life! I love my life!
"Brian's Song"!
-The meeting went great?
-So great!
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.
It's not too big or too small.
It's just right.
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know. It's gotta be great.
I know what you can make!
I know!
You should make that thing
with the stuff.
You know that thing with the stuff?
Okay, I don't know.
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?
-Who are you going out with?
-ls this the bug lady?
"I love you, Ross."
Her name is Celia and
she's insect curator at the museum.
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner...
...then bring her back to my place
and introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe....
Well, I don't know....
I'm hoping....
That monkey is a chick magnet.
She'll take one look at his cute,
little face and it'll seal the deal.
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!
Soothing tones.
-Here, Marcel.
-I can't stand this.
-He's got his claws on my
-Yeah, all right.
Okay, try this salmon mousse.
Good.
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?
-It's creamier.
-Yeah? Well, is that better?
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.
God, what happened to you?
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...
...intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?
"You're suited for data processing for
a large multinational corporation."
That's so great!
You already know how to do that.
Can you believe it?
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something cool?
I just always pictured myself
doing something....
Something!
Chandler, I know, I know.
Hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.
Maybe this will cheer you up.
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.
It's supposed to be small.
It's a pre-appetizer.
The French call it an amuse-bouche.
Well, it is amusing.
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.
What did we say, $10 an hour?
Okay, great.
All right, I'll see you then.
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is helping me.
Waitressing?
Of course I thought of you.
But....
-But....
-But, but....
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?
Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.
Took home a bronze.
Amuse-bouche?
Talk to me.
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning
Talk dirty.
-Here?
-Come on. Come on.
Say something hot.
What? What?
Vulva.
Vulva?
I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.
But it wasn't a total loss.
We ended up cuddling.
You cuddled? How many times?
Shut up. It was nice.
I don't think
I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.
Or what other people
might be doing to each other.
I'll tell you what.
Try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Why not?
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.
I'm in my apartment....
-Yeah, what else?
-You're not there.
-We're not having this conversation.
-All right, I'll start. Ready?
Oh, Ross...
...you get me so hot.
I want your lips on me now.
-Now you say something.
-I really don't think so.
You like this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?
Now tell me
you wanna caress my butt!
Okay, turn around.
I don't want you staring at me.
All right, I'm not looking.
Go ahead.
Okay.
I want
Okay, I want...
...to feel your hot, soft skin
with my lips.
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.
I want to take my tongue and
Say it.
Say it!
run it all over your body...
... until you're trembling with
With?
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.
-The trembling thing was nice.
-Shut up!
That guy from your old job
called again.
-Again?
-And again and again and again.
And again.
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?
Yeah, I miss you too.
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.
I need more than a job.
I need something I really care ab
That's on top of the year-end bonus?
Your dream!
Look, Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!
Stop saying numbers!
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy!
I'll see you Monday!
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.
This is a cube!
Look at this.
You have a window!
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautiful view of
Look! That guy's peeing!
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.
Okay, sit down here.
This is great.
-You ready?
-Yeah.
Helen, could you come in here?
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.
Last time I do that.
I promise.
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know. She has no personality.
Wendy, don't do this to me.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you promised.
-Who was that?
-Wendy bailed.
I have no waitress.
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.
Ten dollars an hour!
Twelve dollars an hour!
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....
Twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Hello. Welcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.
Hello, greeter girl.
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.
Everything smells so delicious.
I can't remember ever smelling
such a delicious combination of
Okay, smells.
-It's a lovely apartment.
-Thank you. Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite,
but all right.
-What's up?
-ln the cab on the way over...
...Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja
I'm with you, Cheech.
-Do you think he's gonna be cool?
-ls it dry in here?
Let me get you some wine.
I think we're ready
for our first course too.
These are rock shrimp ravioli
in a cilantro ponzu sauce...
...with just a touch of minced...
...ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!
That's all there is of these...
...but in a few minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.
"Tartlets"?
"Tartlets."
"Tartlets."
Word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.
Cool! Taco shells!
They're like a little
corn envelope, you know?
-You don't wanna spoil your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.
Sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here?
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.
-Give them to me.
-We'll share.
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.
It's not worth it!
Bears overboard! They're drowning!
Don't just stand there.
Call 9-1 -1.
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!
Help! Help, I'm drowning!
-That's it! Dinner is over!
-What! Why?
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?
I can't think of an example.
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...
...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes
for a tartlet?
So I told him,
"I'm sorry. That's how I feel."
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.
Then I said, "Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet."
And he didn't listen,
so we left him in the emergency room.
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tool.
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.
I just thought that this was it.
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Am I gonna get paid
for the full three hours?
Just a question.
We'll talk about it later.
So, how did it go with Celia?
-I was unbelievable.
-All right, Ross!
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.
It was the most elaborate filth
ever heard.
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines, themes, a motif.
At one point, there were villagers.
And?
By the time we finished
all the dirty talk...
...it was late
and we were exhausted
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?
-Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
-Where the hell is he?
I know what time it is...
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!
Let me tell you something.
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!
How's this?
Sorry. How about over here?
That means it's working.
-Does this hurt?
-No.
How about this?
There you go!
I'm gonna throw up!
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!
You barge in here
and you don't knock?
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?!
That's a relatively open weave.
I can still see...
...your nippular areas.
The One With The Boobies
Honey, tell them the story
about your patient...
...who thinks things are
other things.
When the phone rings
and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
-But you tell it really well, sweetie.
-Thanks. Okay.
Now go away so we can
talk about you.
Okay. I'll miss you.
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute. He likes you so much.
I know. He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky.
Think you'll do it on his couch?
I don't know. That's a little weird.
It's vinyl.
Okay, you guys want anything else?
-Could I have?
-We're all out. Anybody else?
Did I miss something?
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?
It was an accident. I wasn't
across the street with a telescope.
Can we change the subject, please?
These aren't her "boobies."
These are her breasts.
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.
I always liked "Bazoombas."
Gives them a Latin spin.
Can we drop this already, please?
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.
"Nice"? They were "nice"?
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.
You're so funny!
He's really funny.
I wouldn't wanna be there
when the laughter stops.
Whoa, back up there, sparky.
What did you mean by that?
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.
Only child, right?
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days. I got a job.
I'm better off staying with Joey...
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.
-Good to meet you.
-You too.
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?
0 for 2, huh?
Chandler, say something funny.
I gotta go. Miss you too.
-I love you, but it's getting late
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.
I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and
Excuse me?
Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni.
She's a pet mortician.
Sure.
So, how long you been...?
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the navy yard?
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garlic.
You don't crush it?
You're having an affair,
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.
Joe, you ever been in love?
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,
it's with two different women.
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?
It's like if you woke up
and found out...
...your dad leads this double life.
He's like actually some spy
working for the ClA.
That'd be cool.
This blows!
Do you think Dad cheated?
I don't think so.
That would involve sex.
I'd like to think that our parents
don't do that.
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have?
Why...
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?
What?
What?
Didn't you get a good enough look?
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.
You know,
I don't see that happening.
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!
Come on up.
Oh, good! Rog is here.
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing. I hate that guy!
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.
Come on, he's not that bad.
You're wrong! Why would I marry her...
...if I thought that she was
a lesbian?
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.
Why? Why would l? Why?
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.
Well, I don't know.
You could've sabotaged
your marriage...
...so the sibling would feel like
less of a failure.
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.
I thought you were on my side.
But maybe you sucked up
to them so they'd favor you.
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!
You're right. I mean, you're right.
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but the Weeble Play Palace...
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...
...with this lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.
And Mom just gave them all away.
That's tough, tough stuff.
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta go.
-Feel better.
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.
Listen, it was great seeing you again.
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?
Remember, they're just food,
they're not love.
I hate that guy!
Good night, you guys.
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.
Hey, can we help you?
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.
I'm Ronni.
Cheese Nip?
Joey's having an embolism,
but I'd go for a nip.
Most people,
when their pets pass on...
...want them like they're sleeping.
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.
Like chasing their tail.
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.
Joey, if I go first,
I wanna be looking for my keys.
-That's a good one!
-Hey.
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?
Oh, you left your hair at my place.
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.
Thank you.
So, who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?
Look, I shouldn't have come.
I better go. I'll miss the train.
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay? Here?
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.
I want you here so I can
keep an eye on you.
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.
As long as you are under my roof...
...you're gonna live by my rules.
That means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.
Wow, he's strict.
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.
And Chandler will be?
Out here with me, bunking up.
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,
don't be alarmed.
Thanks. You're a good kid.
I'll show you to my room.
That sounds weird not followed by,
"No, it's late."
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.
Change?
-Break up with Ronni
-I can't!
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!
Hey, kickie!
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.
I was thinking about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls....
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?
You know, how I date all these women.
I always figured, when the right one
comes along...
... I'll be able to go the distance.
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking
You're not him, you're you.
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?
-No.
-No.
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.
That wasn't easy, but you did it.
I believe when the right woman
comes along...
...you'll have the guts to say,
"No, thanks, I'm married."
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I really do.
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!
-Hi.
-Hi. May I help you?
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.
Okay. Who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
The mistress?
-Come on in.
-Thanks.
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.
Ronni, how long has Chandler
been in the shower?
Oh, like five minutes.
Perfect.
Fasten your seat belts,
it's pee-pee time.
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
-How's it going?
-Good.
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.
It's just....
It's Roger, you know?
There's something about
We just feel that he's....
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.
Don't you think it's just that
he's so perceptive...
...it freaked you out?
No, we hate him!
I'm sorry.
-Ma! What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!
Big ring!
Why'd you fill your father's head
with garbage...
...about making things right?
Things were fine this way!
There's chicken in there. Put it away.
For God's sake, Joey! Really.
-Hold on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?
Your father is no James Bond.
You should've heard his stories.
"I'm sleeping over
at my accountant's."
-What is that? Please!
-So then, how could you?
Do you remember
how your father used to be?
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...
... but what the hell
are you talking about?
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.
Look, honey, in an ideal world...
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.
And something else:
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...
... he's so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.
He's been more loving. It's like
every day is our anniversary.
-I'm happy for you?
-Well, don't be!
Now everything's screwed up.
I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I just did what
I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.
So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah.
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.
Could I take her?
With this ring, no contest.
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!
-What?
-I'm sorry.
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
-Okay.
It's nothing. I'm fine.
It's just It's my friends.
They have a liking problem with you...
...in that they don't.
They don't?
But they don't see all
the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good
and sweet stuff.
-They think you're a little
-What?
Intense and creepy.
-Oh.
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.
It's quite typical behavior...
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, this kind of codependent,
emotionally stunted...
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...
...which might as well
have nipples on them.
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me! Define me!
Love me! I need love!
You talked to your dad?
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
like she wanted.
Ma will keep pretending
she doesn't know.
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.
He got a restraining order.
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.
Things have changed here
on Waltons'mountain.
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.
It's just You know, they're parents.
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.
You gotta let them
make their own mistakes.
And think, in a few years,
we'll turn into them.
Oh, please.
If I turn into my parents, I'll be
an alcoholic blond chasing men...
...or I'll end up like my mom!
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.
-What happened?
-I don't know. I mean...
... he's a good person,
and he can be really sweet.
In some ways,
I think he is so right for me.
It's just.... I hate that guy!
Hi, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks
for the boobie payback.
Next stop, Rachel Greene.
Joey, what the hell were you doing?
Sorry, wrong boobies!
Hello, Joey!
Hello, dear!
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.
Oh, my God! Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy...
...who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.
Come to mama.
He's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.
-We should do something. Whistle.
-I' m not whistling.
Come on, do it!
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
I can't believe you did that.
The One With Mrs. Bing
-It's all my fault.
-No, it's mine.
Why did I whoo-hoo?
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...
... " I Iove that sound.
I must have you now"?
I wish there was something
we could do.
Hello, coma guy.
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!
What are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.
I hate that they're
calling him John Doe.
It's so sad. It's Iike he's a deer,
a female deer.
Oh, I was gonna stop.
Look at that face.
Even sleeping he Iooks smart.
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.
Okay. He's a Iawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.
And he can dance.
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's Iistening...
... not saying, " I understand "...
... but really wondering
what you Iook Iike naked.
I wish all guys could be Iike him.
I know.
You don't even know this guy.
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?
He doesn't have anyone.
We feel kind of responsible.
I can't believe you said "whoo-hoo. "
I don't even say "whoo-hoo. "
Oh, she's coming up.
When we return, we 'll talk with
the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
Put the kids to bed for this one.
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie 's
is on Showtime and HBO.
No way.
-She's your mom.
-Exactly. Weekend at Bernie 's.
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.
I gotta tell you,
I Iove your mom's books.
I can't get on a plane without one.
This is so cool.
You wouldn't think so
if you were 1 1...
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.
I remember page 79.
The thing after the opera
with the girl with the trick hip?
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a blast.
That's because she's not your mom.
Oh, please. She's the
Hi, sweetie.
When did " Rigatoni " get back from Rome?
-Last night.
-Really?
So, his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?
Just a dream I had.
But, phew!
Hey, she's on.
Nora Bing.
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?
Your mom was arrested?
I'm busy beaming with pride.
This is kind of embarrassing...
...but occasionally, after
I've been intimate with a man...
Why would she say that's embarrassing?
...I just get this craving
for kung pao chicken.
That's too much information.
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.
Oh, God, I Iove her!
I think I' m having a stroke.
So how is your book tour going?
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.
But I get to see my son, who I love.
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.
Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom.
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.
I bought my son his first condoms.
And then he burst into flames.
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.
And teams played sports.
What about GIen?
He could be a GIen.
Not special enough.
How about Agamemnon?
Way too special.
I'm famished. What do I want?
PIease, God, don't Iet it be
kung pao chicken.
You watched the show.
What did you think?
I think you need to come out
of your shell.
What is this dive?
Only you could've picked this place.
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?
Well, you know what they say:
Be careful what you wish for.
-I think we' re ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.
There you go. Ross?
I' m not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.
Hi. Sorry we' re Iate.
We kind of just, you know,
Iost track of time.
But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Well, I' m gonna go to tinker-town.
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
I wanted to become a writer.
Oh, please.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Start with half a dozen
European cities...
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...
...and you've got yourself a book.
My mother, Iadies and gentlemen.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I' m fine.
What is with you tonight?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.
Okay, thank you.
It's the Italian hand-Iicker, isn't it?
No. It's the one he's Iicking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You' re good.
I have sold 1 00 million copies
of my books, and you know why?
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in Iove with.
I cannot sell a Paolo.
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.
When?
He's not a hero.
You know who our hero is?
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?
No, it's you.
-PIease.
-No, really.
Come on. You' re smart. You' re sexy.
-Right.
-Yes, you are.
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.
Come on, kiddo.
You' re gonna be fine, believe me.
I'II just pee in the street.
Is Chandler here?
Wait. Come here.
Okay, about Iast night...
...you know...
... Chandler, you didn't tell....
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?
Right. No big deal.
In bizarro world.
You broke the code.
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.
But not a mom. Never a mom.
What are you guys doing out here?
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.
But apparently somebody overslept.
Well, you don't have your racquet.
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Well, you didn't call
and Ieave your grip size.
You guys are spending
way too much time together.
I' m scum. I' m scum.
-How could you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.
It's not Iike she's a regular mom.
She's sexy. She's....
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well, not in the same way.
I'II have you know, GIoria T ribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.
What are you doing here?
Not playing racquetball.
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.
Sounds Iike you two have issues.
Goodbye, baby.
Do they wait for me to do this?
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?
If you don't, his mother might.
What are you guys doing here?
He's not even wearing a jock strap.
What did I ask?
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...
...that I, you know.
So, what are you doing here?
I' m not really here.
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.
Do you come here a Iot...
...without me?
No, no, no.
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?
How would I know? I wasn't here.
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?
Oh, my God.
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.
I can't believe it.
Paolo kissed my mom?
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a Iot.
I mean, you know how he gets
I can't do this. I did it.
It was me. I' m sorry.
I kissed your mom.
What?
I was upset about Rachel and
I had too much tequila, and Nora...
... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...
... being nice.
But nothing happened.
Nothing. Ask Joey.
-Joey came in
-You knew about this?
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're Iucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?
Thanks, man. Big help.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't. I don't know. I
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this.
-Me neither.
-I' m mad at you too.
-Why are you mad at me?
-Let me slam the door.
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?
"A Woman Undone,
by Rachel IKaren Greene. "
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.
Do you think his "Iove stick" can be
"Iiberated from its denim prison"?
Yeah, I'd say so.
And there's no "J " in "engorged. "
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?
No. You?
You just asked me.
Maybe it was a trick question.
Rachel, can we do this now?
I am so hot.
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.
-I can't believe this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks.
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recently met...
...who's come to be
very important to me.
You don 't have to be awake
To be my man
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand
Though we just met the other day
There 's something I have got to say
Thank you very much.
I' m gonna take a short break.
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started
I was talking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?
" Mother-kisser. "
I'II shut up.
I know you' re still mad at me...
... but there were two people
there that night.
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Then why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated.
It's complex.
You kissed my mom.
We' re rehearsing a Greek play.
That's funny.
Are we done now?
You mean you' re not gonna
tell her how you feel?
Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom...
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't talk to her.
Okay. "You can't"?
Or you can't?
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.
Still doing the play.
What did you do with him?
-You're awake.
-Look at you.
How do you feel?
A Iittle woozy, but basically okay.
Gosh, you Iook good.
I feel good.
Who are you?
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.
I' m Monica.
I've been caring for you.
We both have.
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-Actually, me.
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.
-I read to you.
-I sang.
Well, thanks.
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You' re welcome.
So I guess I'II see you around.
What? That's it?
"See you around "?
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.
Maybe...
... "That was nice. "
" It meant something to me. "
" I'II call you. "
-Okay. I'II call you.
-I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical.
You know, we give and we give...
...and we give.
And we just get nothing back.
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, "See you around. "
Let's go, Phoebe.
You know what?
We thought you were different.
But I guess it was just the coma.
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you' re there is enough.
AII right. Well, be good.
I Iove you.
You kissed my best Ross.
Or something to that effect.
Look, it was stupid.
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.
I don't even know how it happened.
I' m sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.
Really, really stupid.
Really, really stupid.
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.
No.
The forbidden Iove
of a man and his door.
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss.
You're kidding?
He said, "When are you gonna
start being a mom? "
Then she said:
"The question is, when are you gonna
realize I have a bomb? "
Are you sure she didn't say:
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom? "
-That makes more sense.
-You think?
What's going on now?
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.
I don't hear anything. Wait.
What do you see?
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.
Wait, wait, wait.
They're walking away.
They're walking away.
No, they' re not. They' re coming
right at us. Run!
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I' m okay.
AII right. You be good.
Drive safe.
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.
You mean that?
Yeah, why not?
So I told her.
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.
Couldn't have gone worse.
-Well, how do you feel?
-Pretty good.
I told her.
Well, see?
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?
But we don't have to
go down that road.
This is just the first chapter...
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her " heaving beasts. "
She could have heaving beasts.
Right, but in this case she doesn't.
What's a " niffle"?
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.
Okay, so I' m not a great typist.
Did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.
That's it. Give them back.
Wait, I just got to the part
about her "public hair. "
